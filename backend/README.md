# WorkerManager Backend

You are in the root dir of the backend. The backend uses Springboot. You are recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA as your development IDE.

To run or debug using IntelliJ IDEA, open
```
src/main/java/ai/boltzbit/interview/worker/manager/Application.java
```
and click the green run button left of `public class Application` .

To build the integrated service along with the frontend, go to the parent folder and
```
nvm clean package
```
